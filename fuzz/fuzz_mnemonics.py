"""An atheris harness fuzzing every decoder that reads a mnemonic.

A SLIP-0039 share is handed back by whoever held it, and SLIP-0039's
threshold is there because some of those holders may be compromised:
`slip39.share_from_mnemonic` reads its header, padding and checksum
before anything about the share is known. The BIP39 and Electrum
readers are the other two ways a sentence enters the package, and they
take the same input: `bip39.entropy_from_mnemonic` and
`electrum.version_from_mnemonic` both read the words, the latter
hashing the sentence and testing it against the pre-2.0 word-list
first.

Every other decoder `tests/fuzz_test.py` lists is called on the same
text: the language, entropy, seed, master key and word index readers, and
the recombination of shares, which takes one share per line.

A crash here on hostile input is a defect in the decoder, never in this
harness: `data` is decoded as UTF-8 and handed straight to each entry
point, bytes that are no UTF-8 being refused before any of them could
be. `BTClibMnemonicsException` is what each answers malformed input
with, so that family is caught below as the expected outcome; any other
exception propagates to atheris as the finding it is. A share that
decodes is encoded again, and has to spell the sentence it came from as
`normalize_mnemonic` reads it: a word is looked up in its NFKD form, so
a fullwidth letter is read as the letter.

The seed corpus is one sentence of each scheme.
