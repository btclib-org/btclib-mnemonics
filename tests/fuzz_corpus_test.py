"""A fuzz/corpus/ seed is still a sentence one of its entry points reads.

`fuzz/fuzz_<name>.py` and `fuzz/corpus/fuzz_<name>/` are read from disk;
neither is imported. Every harness imports atheris at module level,
which is CI-only and undeclared in `[dependency-groups]`, so this module
never runs `import fuzz.fuzz_<name>` and never executes a harness's own
code -- it parses the source with `ast` and resolves what a harness
*names* against the installed package instead.

`ENTRY_POINTS`, a module-level tuple of `"module:name"` string literals,
is what each harness names, and what `fuzz_target`'s own body calls is
asked to be exactly that. Every seed is then tried against every entry
point, and passes if at least one reads it without raising
`BTClibMnemonicsException`; a seed the SLIP-0039 decoder reads has to
encode back to its own bytes.

What this gate is for is keeping the fuzzer's own starting point honest
as the decoders move under it. A crash the fuzzer finds is a test of the
ordinary suite, naming the input and what the decoder now does with it,
and never a seed: this gate would refuse a crash input added here.
