"""Tests that a keyword-only parameter stays keyword-only.

`*` in a signature is a calling-convention promise, and a mutant of `*`
to `/` drops the keyword-only rule and adds a positional-only one in its
place with every call already written still answering the same (issue
btclib-org/btclib#980). The property is mechanical, one
`inspect.signature(...).parameters[name].kind` per site, so walking
`__all__` once covers every site.

`KEYWORD_ONLY` is that walk, run once against the current tree and
frozen here rather than recomputed by the test: recomputing it from the
same code the test is meant to guard would make the assertion read
whatever a mutation had just done to it and call that the answer. It is
empty, no public signature of this package taking a keyword-only
parameter, and that is itself the recorded answer: a keyword-only
parameter added to the public surface is a site this table does not
hold, and the test below fails until it does.

A function under a module's `__all__` is named directly; a class is
named once per public method of its own -- `__init__`, and every other
name in its own `__dict__` that does not start with an underscore.
An inherited method is walked where it is defined and not under a
subclass that does not override it.
