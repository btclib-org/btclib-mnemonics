"""Tests for `btclib_mnemonics.exceptions`, and for who catches what it raises.

The classes add nothing to their bases, so what is tested is the
hierarchy: one base to catch everything the package raises, and each
class a subclass of the built-in that names its kind of failure. The
second half is what a caller written against `except ValueError` relies
on, and the last test asks it of a refusal the package actually raises
rather than of the class alone.
