"""Every `bool` parameter of the package, classified and held to its class.

A kind written down and read back -- json, a configuration file, a
coordinator's message -- arrives as whatever it was written as, and
`"false"` is true (issue btclib-org/btclib#868).

## The line

A **truth** only decides whether the call refuses: `verify_checksum=False`
says do not check, and the answer is the same one. So a value read for its
truth runs a check or skips one and changes no answer, which is why
nothing is refused there.

A **kind** decides what a non-refusing call computes or returns. `"no"`
is true, so a kind read for its truth quietly computes the other answer
-- the other entropy, the other set of shares -- and that is what the
refusal is for.

## The polarity a truth has to have

`"no"` is true, and so is every other wrong value, so the misreading is
never "the flag was off": it is always the one the flag's `True` stands
for. That is what makes a truth safe rather than the fact that it changes
no answer: the wrong value falls on the side that refuses more. So a
truth's `True` has to be its conservative value, and a flag whose `True`
is the permissive one is a kind however little it computes (issue
btclib-org/btclib#884).

The two tests below are that line, one each:

- a kind refuses `"no"`, `0`, `1` and (where the annotation does not
  declare it) `None`, with a `BTClibMnemonicsTypeError`
- a truth **accepts** them, on a fixture the flag's `True` accepts: a
  truth that starts refusing fails here, and the entry has to move rather
  than the test being edited

## The walk

`_bool_parameters` reads every public function of the package and every
`bool`-annotated parameter of one, so a flag added anywhere is either in a
table here or the run is red -- there is no third table, and that is the
state to keep.
