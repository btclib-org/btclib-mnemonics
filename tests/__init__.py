"""The btclib_mnemonics test suite, and the code its modules share.

The vector files are the reference implementations' and electrum's:
read them here and hand them to `pytest.mark.parametrize`, so that a
vector is a test rather than one turn of a loop inside a single test
function: a failure names the vector instead of the loop that was running
it, and the vectors after the first failure still run -- a loop stops at
the first one and reports nothing about the rest.

Here rather than in a `tests/vectors.py`: every Python file under `tests/`
is a test file except `__init__.py` and `conftest.py`, so shared test
code lives in the package `__init__`.

This package is imported by every test module, before that module's own
body runs. Whatever this file executes at import time therefore executes
inside every module's own measured reach: the suite's coverage floor
reads what the import reaches, never what a test body goes on to call. A
literal is safe to share here at module scope. Anything that calls into
the package's own arithmetic is shared as a function instead, computed
only when a caller invokes it.
