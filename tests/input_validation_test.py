"""The gate for the two rules about a public function's inputs.

> Every public function guarantees the validation of all its inputs,
> directly or indirectly. A malformed argument leaves as
> `BTClibMnemonicsTypeError` or `BTClibMnemonicsValueError`.

CONTRIBUTING.md's "Every public function validates its inputs" states it,
and which of the two classes comes out is not a coin toss -- it is the
distinction issue btclib-org/btclib#814 settled, so this file drives the
two separately:

- **a value of a type the signature does not declare** is the caller's
  own mistake, and leaves as a `BTClibMnemonicsTypeError`.
- **a value of a declared type that no valid input carries** is a fact
  about the input, and leaves as a `BTClibMnemonicsException`.

## How it calls what it calls

The input types are few and declared in this package: `Mnemonic` in
`mnemonic.py`, `BinStr` and `Entropy` in `entropy.py`, `Octets` in
`_utils.py`. `_WRONG_TYPE` and `_WRONG_VALUE` give each of them values of
the two kinds, and the walk finds every public module-level function
whose *required* parameters are all of those types. Those it can call
with no fixture and no knowledge of what the function does.

Every argument is wrong at once, which is not weaker than one wrong
argument among valid ones: whichever the function refuses first, the rule
says how it must refuse it. And it needs no valid values, which is what
makes the walk automatic.

## What it does not reach

A **parameter with a default** is never driven: to reach it the arguments
before it would have to be valid, which is the table this design is built
to do without. `tests/bool_parameter_test.py` carries that table for the
`bool` ones.

A **method**, and a function taking a plain `str`, `int`, a `Share` or a
callback, needs a value the vocabulary does not build, and is driven by
the tests of its own module. `test_the_walk_reaches_what_it_claims` pins
what the walk does find, so a narrowing of it fails here rather than
quietly running over less.

A function whose answer is a reading of any value of its type, rather
than a check of it, answers a wrong value too: `_ANSWERS_A_WRONG_VALUE`
names each the walk reaches, with its reason, and the second rule is
asserted of them the other way round.
