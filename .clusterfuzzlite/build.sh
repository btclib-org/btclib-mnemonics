# at $SRC/btclib-mnemonics (the Dockerfile's WORKDIR).
#
# What the install takes is uv.lock's and not the index's.
# requirements.txt beside this file is the lock exported -- the package's
# runtime dependencies, of which it has none, and the `fuzz` dependency
# group's build backend, each with its hashes -- and the uv-export hook of
# .pre-commit-config.yaml rewrites it whenever uv.lock moves.
# --require-hashes refuses a file the lock does not name. The package
# itself follows with --no-deps and --no-build-isolation, which builds it
# with the backend just installed rather than one resolved off the index.
#
# Editable, because OpenSSF Scorecard's Pinned-Dependencies check reads a
# pip install as pinned only with --require-hashes, a wheel file, or `-e`
# and --no-deps (isUnpinnedPipInstall, ossf/scorecard's
# checks/raw/shell_download_validate.go), and pip refuses
# --require-hashes for a directory. The tree `-e` points at is the one
# the Dockerfile copied in, so pinned is what it is.
#
# The shape -- install, discover, compile -- is
# docs/build-integration/python_lang.md's own example build.sh for a
# Python project.

# compile_python_fuzzer forwards every extra argument straight to
# pyinstaller, ahead of the fuzzer's own path (base-builder's own
# compile_python_fuzzer script). --collect-data=btclib_mnemonics is what
# closes a gap PyInstaller's own analysis does not: `mnemonic` reads the
# word-lists under the package's `_data/` directory, from a path built
# off `__file__`, and a frozen onefile executable bundles no non-Python
# file PyInstaller cannot trace a reference to.
#
# The same loop also zips each target's own seed corpus, one
# fuzz/corpus/<name>/ directory per fuzzer, under the name libFuzzer picks
# up next to a target's own binary with no configuration -- so a new
# fuzz_*.py with a corpus directory beside it is picked up here without a
# second list of names to keep in step with the first.
