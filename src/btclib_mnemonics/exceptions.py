"""Exception classes.

These exist only to tell an exception raised by btclib_mnemonics from one
raised by any other code: each derives from the built-in that says what
kind of failure it is, and adds nothing to it.

`BTClibMnemonicsException` is what makes that telling apart a single
`except` rather than a tuple a caller has to keep in step with this
hierarchy. It is inherited *beside* the built-in and not instead of it,
which is the half that matters: `BTClibMnemonicsValueError` is a
`ValueError`, so code catching the built-in catches it, and
`json.JSONDecodeError` is the standard library doing the same.

It is caught and never raised: every raise in the package is one of the
two below it, and which one answers a question the base cannot carry --
whether the value was wrong or the type was. A caller with something to
do about that difference names the specific class; `except
BTClibMnemonicsException` is for the caller who only needs to know it came
from here.

The classes are this package's own rather than `btclib`'s, which is what
keeps the package free of any import of `btclib`: a caller catching
`btclib.exceptions.BTClibValueError` does not catch these, and one
catching `ValueError` catches both.
