"""The btclib_mnemonics package: what it publishes, and the version metadata.

BIP39, SLIP-0039 and the Electrum mnemonic schemes, from the entropy to
the seed, with the entropy sources they are generated from. Nothing
above the seed is here: the standard library is the package's only
dependency.

`__all__` here is the root of the package's public tree: the modules a
caller reaches from this name. Each of them declares its own `__all__`,
so a walk that starts here has a declared surface at every node -- which
is why the list is not `pkgutil.iter_modules`: discovery would answer
the file tree, and a module added to the directory would publish itself
rather than being published.

`name` is not in it, nor are the metadata dunders. `name` is the
distribution's name and not a member of the tree, `__version__` bound by
a star import would overwrite the importing module's own, and each is
still an attribute here: `btclib_mnemonics.__version__` is how a caller
reads the version and `btclib_mnemonics.name` how it reads the name.

Nothing is imported eagerly. A module is imported when it is first asked
for, through the `__getattr__` at the bottom of this file, so `import
btclib_mnemonics` is the metadata lookup below and nothing else, and the
import graph keeps its shape: importing every module here would put the
whole package in `sys.modules` before any single module of it could be
imported first, which is the situation tests/imports_test.py exists to
make impossible.

What that costs is worth stating: mypy reads a module-level `__getattr__`
as a promise that any attribute may exist, so `btclib_mnemonics.bip93` is
`Any` to it and a misspelling on this package is a runtime
`AttributeError` rather than a reported error. The spellings a caller
actually writes -- `from btclib_mnemonics import bip39`, `import
btclib_mnemonics.bip39`, `from btclib_mnemonics.bip39 import
seed_from_mnemonic` -- resolve against the real modules and stay checked.
