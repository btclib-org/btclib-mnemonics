"""The coercions every public function runs its inputs through.

Copies of `btclib.utils.assert_type`, `bytes_from_octets` and
`is_integer`, and of `btclib.alias.Octets`, raising this package's own
exceptions: importing them from `btclib` would make a package that
answers for mnemonics up to the seed depend on the whole of a bitcoin
library. `bytes_from_octets` is copied without the `out_size` parameter,
which nothing here passes.

A copy can drift from its original with every gate green, so
`tests/utils_test.py` runs both on one table of inputs and asks them for
the same answer, or for a refusal from the same built-in class. `utf8_bytes`
is this package's own and has no original.
